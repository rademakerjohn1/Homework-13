# Burger App

This application uses the MVC framework to allow users to input and change data that will be stored in a SQL databse.

The user can input a value (burger name) that will be stored in a SQL database and rendered onto the page.  The user can click a button to update a boolean value for a given item in the database; the page will then re-render to reflect the changed state.
